# Python 2 and Python 3 compared by examples

It's not a full list, but my list gathered directly from "What's new"
series for every Python 3 release.

Assuming that you're starting from Python 2.7 this can be a helpful
quick overview that's I see worth to be aware of.

If you find other new cool features from Python 3 that are missing
feel free to contribute :)

## How to use

Just click on every `python3.x` file and see nicely rendered
Jupyter Notebooks provided by github viewer.

## Local usage

### Setup

```
conda create -n py2py3 python=3.8
conda activate py2py3
pip install jupyterlab
``` 

### Start exploration

```
cd python2_python3_differences/
jupyter notebook
```

Notebook will be opened in a moment with a contents of this repo.
